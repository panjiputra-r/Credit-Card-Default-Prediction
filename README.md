# Credit Card Default Prediction

## Introduction
This project develops a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a credit card payment default based on user data. It involves data analysis and the application of various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Analysis of credit card data.
- Predictive modeling using Logistic Regression, KNN, and SVM.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
